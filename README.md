## Data Cleaning Exercise (07.6 and 30 points) âœ”
1. Have a look at the following dataset: https://github.com/edlich/eternalrepo/blob/master/DS-WAHLFACH/dsm-beuth-edl-demodata-dirty.csv

    Write a Python / Panda Script which 'cleans' this data set. Justify your actions in the respective notebook or python script you provide as a solution (link, file, kaggle repo, etc.).
    
    The original dataset does not necessarily have to be created. A proper strategy / good arguments are more important. Value: 5 points.
